# Smart-Methods

# Task1

In this task, I worked on a control panel for a robotic arm. I did HTML, JS, and PHP on the same page. The HTML code is the structure, and the JS has the functions, and the PHP is dealing with the database which is made by MySQL.

# Task2

In this task, I worked on a control panel for the base of the robot. I did HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP on the same page. The HTML code is the structure, and the CSS is representing the design, and the JS has the functions, and the PHP is dealing with the database which is made by MySQL.

# Task3

In this task, I added a chatbot to the control panel page by using IBM watson and adding it's script to the HTML file.
